Note on exclusion of extremely implausible values from the graphs:

In DELP update 20220104, Global daily deaths start from about 800,000 around 2021-10-01 and 
come down toward plausible values around 2021-10-22. Similar issue in WHO regions and in Daily Cases. 
Such values compress down the curves of other models in daily deaths graphs. 
As such, the implausible values are regarded as missing here.

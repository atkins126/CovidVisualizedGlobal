Note on exclusion of very implausible values:

In DELP update 20220104, Global daily deaths start from about 800,000 around 2021-10-01 and come down toward plausible values around 2021-10-22. That compresses down the curves of other models in daily deaths graphs. As such, the implausible values are regarded as missing here.
